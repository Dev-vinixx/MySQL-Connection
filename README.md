# User Management Project

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the User Management Project. This is a simple Java application that allows you to manage users in a MySQL database. It's perfect for those who are just starting out with Java and want to learn how to interact with a database.

## What's Inside?

The project consists of the following main components:

- `DatabaseConnection`: This class is like our project's control room. It's responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the database.
- `UserDao`: Think of this as our project's action hero! ðŸ¦¸ It contains the `createUser` method that bravely ventures into the database to insert a new user.
- `User`: This class is the blueprint of a user in our system. It represents a user with an `id`, `name`, and `age`.

## Getting Started

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine. You can use your favorite Git client or the command line for this.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. We don't discriminate, all IDEs are welcome here! ðŸ˜‰
3. Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. If not, there are plenty of great guides out there to help you get it set up.
4. Update the database credentials in the `DatabaseConnection` class to match your MySQL setup.
5. Now the fun part - run the project and start managing users!
